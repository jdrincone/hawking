      - tipo: lista
        items:
          - "<strong>Production–quality relationship</strong>: Is there a correlation between 
             production speed (performance) and pellet durability?"

          - "<strong>Impact of moisture (or process variables)</strong>: What is the effect of changing moisture
             or other critical variables? If I vary moisture by Y%, how does it affect production and product quality?"

          - "<strong>Raw material and formulation</strong>: How do fat, starch, and fiber proportions influence productivity and quality? 
             What are the ideal ingredient combinations?"

          - "<strong>Motor overload and quality</strong>: At what level of amperage in the conditioner 
            or pellet mill is quality compromised?"

          - "<strong>Paddle configuration</strong>: What paddle design maximizes efficiency and 
            either maintains or improves durability?"

          - "<strong>Most influential variable</strong>: Which variable explains the greatest variation 
            in pellet quality within the plant?"

          - "<strong>Early quality prediction</strong>: What are the key variables and in what range 
            must they be maintained to ensure durability above X%?"

          - "<strong>Quality limits in long processes</strong>: How do quality variables degrade in long processes 
            (processes with a considerable number of batches)?"

          - "<strong>Detect equipment failures</strong>: What is the maximum time for replacing the die 
            (plant consumables) due to wear? What would be the economic loss of not replacing the consumable on time?"

  - titulo: '<h3 style="text-align: center;">With data, we can ask direct questions like: within a certain production range, what quality is obtained? Or inverse questions like: if I want a specific quality value, what range of production parameters should I adjust?</h3>'
