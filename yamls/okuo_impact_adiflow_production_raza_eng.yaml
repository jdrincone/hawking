          This report was developed using the Okuo Flow platform, a tool focused on the 
          <strong>centralization</strong>, <strong>integration</strong>, and <strong>transformation</strong> 
          of data related to production and quality in feed plants. Thanks to this platform, 
          it is possible to extract valuable information that facilitates decision-making by simultaneously 
          analyzing production variables (processed tons, production times, and sack-off) and 
          quality variables (temperature, pellet durability, and moisture). This enables 
          <strong>performance optimization</strong> while maintaining high quality standards, 
          reducing friction between production and quality departments, and achieving a smoother 
          and more efficient process.

          <br><br>
          In this context, we will use Okuo Flow to provide a statistical understanding of the different 
          parameters measured.

        html: A systematically higher load is observed with the use of Adiflow, as well as 
              higher pressures. In the case of temperature, significant differences are observed 
              only for Pellet machine 1. For the others, differences should be analyzed according 
              to the pelleted diets.

        html: With Adiflow, we improved pellet durability in Pellet machine 4. In Pellet machine 2 and 3, 
              quality decreased by 0.5%. Given the magnitude of the change with and without Adiflow, 
              we do not have statistical significance to guarantee meaningful changes in durability.

        html: With Adiflow, we consistently have a moisture percentage above 10% before the pelleting 
              process. After the process, moisture levels are maintained.
