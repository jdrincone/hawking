# General Insights

Through the different analyses performed in Galileo, several recurring insights and patterns have been identified across production sites.

## 1. Production Efficiency (OEE)

Analyzing downtime triggers is critical. Common bottlenecks include:
- **Sin Producto:** Logistical delays in raw material supply.
- **Cambio de Dado/Rodillo:** Planned maintenance that can be optimized by batching similar products.
- **Tolva Llena:** Backpressure from the packaging line.

## 2. Quality Indicators

### Humidity Management
Maintaining humidity within the **11.5% - 13.0%** range is vital for pellet stability and shelf life. 
- High humidity (>13%) leads to mold growth.
- Low humidity (<11.5%) reduces production yields and increases brittle breakage.

### PDI (Pellet Durability Index)
The target PDI is usually **> 85%**. 
- Insights show a strong correlation between PDI and the conditioning temperature (targeting **80°C - 85°C**).
- Adjusting the "Gap" between rollers and die significantly improves PDI in difficult diets.

## 3. Species-Specific Performance

Different animal species require different production parameters:
- **Broiler/Ponedora:** High throughput required, sensitive to fine particles (fines).
- **Cerdos:** Specific PDI requirements depending on the growth stage.
- **Experimental Diets:** Often show more variance in production throughput due to novel ingredients.
