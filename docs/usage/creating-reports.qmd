# Creating Reports

Galileo uses a YAML-based configuration system to generate rich HTML reports automatically.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Explore:** Work in a Jupyter Notebook (`exploration/`) to perform your analysis.
2. **Export:** Save your dataframes as CSVs to `data/` and your plots as HTML/PNG to `images/`.
3. **Configure:** Create a `.yaml` file in the `yamls/` directory.
4. **Generate:** Run the report engine to produce the final HTML.

## YAML Configuration

A report YAML defines the metadata and the sections (images, tables, etc.) of the report.

Example `yamls/my_report.yaml`:

```yaml
report_name: "Monthly Production Analysis"
customer: "Aliforte"
date: "2025-12"

sections:
  - type: header
    title: "Executive Summary"
  
  - type: chart
    title: "PDI Trends"
    path: "images/pdi_trend.html"
    description: "Evolution of Pellet Durability Index over the last month."

  - type: table
    title: "Key Metrics"
    path: "data/metrics_summary.csv"
```

## Running the Report Engine

To generate the report, use the following command:

```bash
uv run python -m core.build_report --name my_report.yaml
```

The system will:
1. Load the configuration.
2. Render the HTML using the base template.
3. Save the result in the `reports/` directory.
4. Auto-upload to S3 if configured.
